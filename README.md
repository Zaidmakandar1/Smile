# 😊 Smile Capture

A web application that captures your photo when you **smile**, built using Flask and OpenCV with real-time face and smile detection.

---

## 📸 Overview

**Smile Capture** is a browser-based application that:

- Starts a webcam feed in real-time.
- Detects faces and smiles using Haar Cascades.
- Automatically captures a photo when a strong, genuine smile is detected.
- Stores and displays the captured images.
- Generates a unique 6-digit code for each capture session.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Real-time face and smile detection using OpenCV.
- Smooth fade-in/out animations using CSS.
- Auto-snap photos when a smile is consistently detected.
- Displays captured images with fade-in effects.
- Lightweight and responsive UI.
- Unique code assigned per session for image folder.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (with animation), JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV (with Haar cascades for face and smile detection)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shahid6174/Smile.git
cd Smile
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python ≥ 3.8 installed.

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts:

```bash
# Create virtual environment (on macOS/Linux)
python3 -m venv venv

# or on Windows
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Then install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To deactivate the environment when done:

```bash
deactivate
```

### 3. Download Haar Cascade Files (If not already present)

Place the following XML files inside a folder named `dataset/`:

- [`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml)
- [`haarcascade_smile.xml`](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_smile.xml)

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and visit:
